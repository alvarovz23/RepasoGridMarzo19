            “Welcome back, Agent. The world needs you now more than ever.” – Charles Goodwin, Agency Director. Crackdown
            3 features a brand new story Campaign that you can play alone or with a friend in two-player co-op over Xbox
            Live. Explore the dangerous streets and treacherous heights of the island metropolis, “New Providence”. Use
            your powerful Agent Skills and an arsenal of weapons and equipment to bring the leaders of the cruel and
            corrupt “TerraNova” corporation to justice. As the game begins, the whole world is in peril. “Blackout”
            attacks have thrown cities into chaos. Millions of refugees are on the move. And at the heart of the
            mystery… is a strange element known only as “Chimera”. Now it’s up to the Agency to liberate New Providence
            and stop the Blackout before the whole world plunges into darkness. Time to step it up, Agent! Along with
            the franchise favorite Agency Director, Crackdown 3 features an all-new cast of characters. These ruthless
            bosses of TerraNova will protect their divisions with everything they’ve got. When you hit them, they’ll
            punch back even harder, unleashing retaliatory attacks that can strike anywhere in New Providence. Destroy
            TerraNova assets to weaken the enemy bosses, assault their soaring towers, and terminate their employment.

            ü Wrecking Zone is Crackdown 3’s explosive multiplayer mode where two teams of 5 hyper-agile Agents fight
            for supremacy in cloud-powered arenas of unprecedented destruction. This is where you really step up your
            boom! The Agency is the world’s most elite law-enforcement unit, and the Wrecking Zone is its combat
            simulator, where Agents train with the best to be the best.

            Earn rewards and bragging rights as you test your mettle on multiple maps and modes. But that’s not all…
            Using the power of Azure Cloud Services and Xbox Live, Wrecking Zone enables fully destructible
            environments. Everything is an object you can break. No door? No problem. Use a rocket to blow a hole
            straight through a building! Enemies escaping across a skybridge? Unload with your minigun and take the
            whole bridge down! Want to topple a whole skyscraper on your enemies? You can do that—and more—in Wrecking
            Zone.
